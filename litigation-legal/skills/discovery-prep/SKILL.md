1. Load `CLAUDE.md` for the discovery framework (RHC O.24 / RDC O.24).
2. Gather matter context: parties, pleadings, case summary, document categories.
3. Walk the preparation checklist below.
4. Produce a draft discovery list and affidavit of documents.

## Discovery Framework (RHC O.24)

### Standard Discovery (O.24, r.1)

Each party discloses documents that are or have been in their control and which:
- The party relies upon; OR
- May adversely affect the party's own case; OR
- May adversely affect another party's case; OR
- May support another party's case.

**The Peruvian Guano test (Compagnie Financière et Commerciale du Pacifique v Peruvian Guano Co (1882)):** A document is discoverable if it contains information that may directly or indirectly advance a party's case or damage another party's case, or which may lead to a train of inquiry that would do either.

### Specific Discovery (O.24, r.7)

If standard discovery is inadequate, apply by summons for specific discovery of:
- Particular documents or classes of documents
- Documents relating to a particular issue

### Pre-action Discovery (O.24, r.7A)

Limited to:
- Personal injury / fatal accident claims
- Applicants must show a potential claim exists
- Discovery limited to specific documents

### Discovery Against Non-parties (O.24, r.7A — limited scope)

## Preparation Checklist

### 1. Identify Document Sources

- [ ] Email accounts / archives
- [ ] Document management systems
- [ ] Shared drives and local files
- [ ] Messaging platforms (Slack, Teams, etc.)
- [ ] Cloud storage (Google Drive, SharePoint, Box)
- [ ] Mobile devices
- [ ] Third-party custodians (consultants, agents, subcontractors)
- [ ] Financial systems and accounting records

### 2. Document Collection

- [ ] Define the search scope by date range, custodians, and keywords
- [ ] Preserve originals (forensic copy if necessary)
- [ ] Collect all responsive documents
- [ ] Document the collection methodology

### 3. Privilege Review

**Categories of privilege:**
- [ ] Legal advice privilege — communications with solicitors for the dominant purpose of legal advice
- [ ] Litigation privilege — communications (including third parties) for the dominant purpose of pending/reasonably contemplated litigation
- [ ] Without prejudice privilege — settlement communications

**Privilege review process:**
- [ ] Review each document for privilege
- [ ] Record privilege claims in a privilege log (document, date, author, privilege type, basis)
- [ ] Ensure privilege is not inadvertently waived
- [ ] Redact privileged portions (redaction must be minimal and justified)

### 4. Discovery List (RHC O.24, Schedule 1)

Organise documents into parts:

**Part 1:** Documents in the party's control (list individually or by class).
**Part 2:** Documents that were but are no longer in the party's control (state when and what happened).
**Part 3:** Documents for which privilege is claimed (list individually; state the nature of the privilege).

### 5. Affidavit of Documents (O.24, r.6)

The affidavit must:
- [ ] Identify the discovery list
- [ ] Verify that the list is complete
- [ ] State the location of documents
- [ ] Specify when documents left the party's control (if applicable)
- [ ] State that a reasonable search has been conducted
- [ ] Describe the scope of the search (custodians, date range, keywords)

**Model affidavit template (O.24, r.6, Form 11):**

> I, [name], of [address], make oath and say as follows:
>
> 1. I am [the defendant / a solicitor / controller of documents].
> 2. I have conducted a reasonable search for documents within my control relevant to the matters in question in this action.
> 3. The search covered: [custodians], [date range], [keywords].
> 4. The documents I have, or have had, in my control are set out in the List of Documents exhibited hereto.
> 5. I have not been able to locate the documents in Part 2 of the List because [reason].
> 6. I object to produce the documents in Part 3 of the List on the ground that they are privileged: [specify privilege].
> 7. I have disclosed all documents of which I am aware that fall within the scope of discovery as defined by O.24, r.1.
>
> Sworn this [date] day of [month], [year].

### 6. Inspection (O.24, r.9)

- Documents in Parts 1 and 2 are available for inspection.
- Documents in Part 3 (privileged) are not available — privilege log provided.
- Inspection by appointment or electronic copy.
