1. Load `CLAUDE.md` for the pleadings framework (RHC O.18 / RDC O.18).
2. Ask for the pleading to review and the stage of proceedings.
3. Walk the review checklist below.
4. Produce a compliance report with flags (`[verify]`, `[review]`) and redline suggestions.

## Review Checklist

### 1. Formal Requirements (O.18, r.6–8)

- [ ] Is the pleading titled with the correct court (CFI / DC)?
- [ ] Is the action number correctly stated?
- [ ] Are the parties correctly named and described?
- [ ] Does the pleading state the relief/defence sought?
- [ ] Is the pleading divided into numbered paragraphs?
- [ ] Are dates, amounts, and references properly particularised?

### 2. Statement of Claim (Plaintiff)

**Substantive compliance:**
- [ ] Does the SoC plead ALL material facts (not evidence)?
- [ ] Are the elements of each cause of action pleaded?
- [ ] Is the cause of action clearly identifiable?
- [ ] Are all losses/damages pleaded and quantified (where possible)?
- [ ] Is interest claimed? Basis stated?
- [ ] Has the contract (if applicable) been identified?
- [ ] Have the breached terms been specified?
- [ ] Are all necessary parties joined? (O.15)

**Common defects to flag:**
- [ ] Bare conclusion without material facts (O.18, r.25)
- [ ] Scandalous or unnecessary matter (O.18, r.19(b))
- [ ] Ambiguous or inconsistent allegations
- [ ] Failure to plead a condition precedent (O.18, r.14)
- [ ] Failure to plead a claim for special damages

### 3. Defence (Defendant)

**Substantive compliance:**
- [ ] Does the Defence respond to EACH allegation (admit, deny with reasons, or require proof)?
- [ ] Are denials specific and reasoned? (O.18, r.13 — general traverse is insufficient)
- [ ] Are set-offs and counterclaims pleaded?
- [ ] Are affirmative defences (limitation, illegality, accord and satisfaction) pleaded?
- [ ] Is contributory negligence pleaded? (O.18, r.9)
- [ ] Are all conditions precedent admitted or denied?

**Common defects to flag:**
- [ ] Bare denial without specification (non-compliance with O.18, r.13(3))
- [ ] Evasive denial (e.g., "the defendant does not admit" without stating the true position)
- [ ] Failure to plead a positive case when required (e.g., alibi in a commercial case)
- [ ] Contradictory defences
- [ ] Scandalous or irrelevant matter

### 4. Reply (Plaintiff)

- [ ] Does the Reply respond to new matters raised in the Defence?
- [ ] Is the Reply confined to answering the Defence — not re-pleading the SoC?
- [ ] If no Reply is filed, is that intentional? (Matters in the Defence not responded to are deemed denied — O.18, r.14(4))

### 5. Counterclaim & Defence to Counterclaim

- [ ] Does the counterclaim arise out of the same transaction or facts? (If not, it may be struck out or ordered separately — O.15, r.5)
- [ ] Is the counterclaim properly pleaded as a separate claim?
- [ ] Has the plaintiff properly responded to the counterclaim?

### 6. Striking Out Grounds (O.18, r.19)

Check whether any part of the pleading could be struck out on the grounds that it:
- [ ] Discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence
- [ ] Is scandalous, frivolous, or vexatious
- [ ] May prejudice, embarrass, or delay the fair trial
- [ ] Is otherwise an abuse of process

### 7. Specific Issues Under HK Practice

- [ ] Is the pleading consistent with the Limitation Ordinance (Cap 347) — filed within the applicable period?
- [ ] Is interest claimed under the High Court Ordinance (Cap 4, s.48 or s.49) or under contract?
- [ ] Are statutory references correct (Cap references)?
- [ ] If an equitable claim is made, is it properly pleaded? (O.18, r.8 — must specify the equitable ground)
