# Cross-Border Transfer — Skill

## Purpose

Analyse cross-border data transfer requirements under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap 486). Unlike the EU GDPR, the PDPO does not have a system of adequacy decisions or specific transfer restriction provisions. Instead, DPP3 (use limitation) applies — data must not be used for a new purpose when transferred overseas. This skill provides a contractual framework for managing cross-border data flows.

## Scope

- PDPO framework: no adequacy regime, no specific transfer restriction
- DPP3 application to cross-border transfers
- Contractual Data Processing Agreement (DPA) approach
- Recommended DPA clauses
- Intra-group data transfers
- Cloud service provider transfers
- Cross-border litigation and e-discovery
- Onward transfer restrictions
- Regulatory risk and evolving standards

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the PDPO Framework

**Key point**: The PDPO does not contain a specific prohibition or restriction on cross-border transfers equivalent to:
- GDPR Chapter V (adequacy, SCCs, BCRs)
- China PIPL Article 38 (security assessment, certification, standard contract)
- South Korea PIPA (consent + notice)

**Instead**, DPP3 (use limitation) governs: personal data transferred out of Hong Kong must still be used only for the original collection purpose or a directly related purpose.

**Practical implication**: The data user in Hong Kong remains responsible for compliance with the PDPO even when data is processed overseas. A contractual framework with the overseas recipient is essential to demonstrate compliance.

### 2. Assess the Transfer

- **Nature of data**: personal identifiers, sensitive data, financial data
- **Volume**: small batch vs large-scale continuous transfer
- **Frequency**: one-off, periodic, continuous
- **Destination**: adequacy risk (does the destination have equivalent protections?)
- **Purpose**: service delivery, HR administration, analytics, marketing, compliance
- **Recipient**: affiliate, third-party processor, cloud provider, law enforcement
- **Transparency**: was the cross-border transfer disclosed to data subjects in the PICS?

### 3. Implement Contractual Framework

#### Data Processing Agreement (DPA) Clauses

The following clauses are recommended for cross-border data processing arrangements:

**1. Definitions and Scope**
- Define "Personal Data", "Processing", "Data User", "Data Processor"
- Specify the categories of personal data and data subjects
- Identify the processing purposes and duration

**2. Data Processing Instructions**
- Processor shall only process data on documented instructions from the data user
- Prohibition on processing for any independent purpose

**3. Confidentiality**
- Confidentiality obligations on all personnel accessing personal data
- Training and awareness obligations

**4. Security Measures**
- Technical and organisational security measures (minimum standard)
- Encryption, access controls, incident detection
- Periodic security audits and reports

**5. Sub-processing and Onward Transfers**
- Restriction on sub-processing without prior written consent
- Equivalent contractual obligations on sub-processors
- Onward transfer restrictions (no transfer to additional parties without consent)

**6. Data Breach Notification**
- Obligation to notify data user without undue delay (within 24–48 hours)
- Cooperation with breach investigation and remediation
- Notification content and format

**7. Data Subject Rights**
- Processor to assist data user in responding to DSARs
- Cooperation with correction requests

**8. Audit and Inspection**
- Right of data user to audit processor's compliance
- Annual compliance report (SOC 2, ISO 27001, or equivalent)

**9. Deletion and Return of Data**
- Obligation to delete or return data on termination of services
- Certification of deletion

**10. Governing Law and Jurisdiction**
- Hong Kong law governs the DPA
- Hong Kong courts have jurisdiction (important for PDPO compliance)

**11. Indemnification**
- Processor indemnifies data user for PDPO contraventions
- Limitations on liability for security breaches

### 4. Intra-Group Data Transfers

**Typical structures**:
- HK subsidiary transfers HR data to global HQ
- HK branch shares customer data with regional data centre
- HK entity uses global CRM/platform shared with overseas affiliates

**Recommended approach**:
- Intra-group data processing agreement (IDA)
- Binding corporate rules equivalent — not recognised by PDPO but good practice
- Group data protection policy with PDPO-specific provisions
- Data flow mapping and risk assessment for each cross-border transfer
- Regular audit of affiliate compliance

### 5. Cloud Service Providers

**Key risks**:
- Data stored on servers outside Hong Kong (jurisdictional risk)
- Sub-processing chains (AWS, Azure, GCP → sub-processors)
- Law enforcement access in foreign jurisdictions (US CLOUD Act, China PIPL)

**Recommended due diligence**:
- Verify data centre locations
- Review contract for PDPO-required clauses
- Confirm no onward transfers without consent
- Check certification: SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, PCI DSS
- Confirm breach notification obligations (24–48 hour target)
- Assess government access risk (tier 1 cloud providers subject to US or China jurisdiction)
- Consider data localisation where legally required (HK does not mandate localisation for PDPO)

### 6. Cross-Border Litigation and E-Discovery

**Key considerations**:
- Litigation in foreign courts may involve discovery requests for personal data
- PDPO does not prevent disclosure required by law (foreign court order)
- BUT resist blanket production — seek protective orders, redaction, and data minimisation
- Use technology-assisted review (TAR) to minimise personal data disclosed

**Recommended approach**:
- Seek Hong Kong court approval for production of data overseas (where possible)
- Apply for foreign court order limiting disclosure to what is necessary
- Redact third-party personal data
- Anonymise or pseudonymise where appropriate
- Document all steps taken to comply with PDPO

### 7. Evolving Regulatory Landscape

**Pending reforms (under consultation as of 2024)**:
- Mandatory data breach notification
- Enhanced cross-border transfer regulations
- Possible data localisation requirements
- Increased penalties

**Monitor**:
- PCPD consultation papers and legislative proposals
- Hong Kong government's Digital Policy and data governance developments
- Regional trends (China PIPL, Singapore PDPA, South Korea PIPA enforcement)
