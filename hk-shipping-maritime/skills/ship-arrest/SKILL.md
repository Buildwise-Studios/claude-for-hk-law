# Ship Arrest — Skill

## Purpose

Guide legal practitioners through the procedure for arresting a ship in Hong Kong waters, including grounds for arrest, warrant procedure, security for release, sister ship arrest, and post-arrest strategy.

## Scope

- Grounds for arrest in rem
- Sister ship arrest (s.12B High Court Ordinance)
- Issuing and serving the warrant of arrest
- Supporting affidavit requirements
- Caveat against arrest
- Security for release (LOU, bank guarantee, cash)
- Ship sale pendente lite
- Wrongful arrest and damages

## Workflow

### 1. Preliminary Assessment

**Determine if arrest is available:**
- Does the claim fall within the CFI's admiralty jurisdiction?
- Is the claim one that supports an in rem action?
- Is the ship physically present in Hong Kong waters or expected within the jurisdiction?
- Does the ship have the same beneficial ownership as the person liable?

**Practical considerations:**
- Value of the ship (is the claim large enough to justify arrest?)
- Costs of arrest and ongoing berthage (HK$30,000–80,000 per day)
- Risk of the ship departing (check AIS tracking — MarineTraffic, VesselFinder)
- Environmental risk (if the ship carries hazardous cargo)
- P&I Club involvement (some clubs provide security proactively)

### 2. Pre-Arrest Steps

- **Search the Admiralty Caveat Book** — check if a caveat against arrest has been filed
- **Check ship ownership** — CR Form 2 (HK Shipping Register), Equasis, IHS Maritime
- **Gather evidence** — contracts, invoices, bills of lading, classification society reports
- **Notify the Harbour Office** — if arrest may affect port operations

### 3. Prepare the Supporting Affidavit

**Contents required (O.70 r.5 RHC):**
1. Full description of the claim
2. Facts giving rise to valid claim against the ship
3. Name of the ship and its flag / port of registry
4. The ship's precise location at the time of application
5. Identify the person who would be liable in personam (owner/charterer)
6. The owner/charterer relationship to the ship at the time of the claim
7. Amount of the claim (principal, interest, costs)
8. Whether any caveat against arrest is known

**Supporting exhibits:**
- Copy of the contract/bill of lading/charterparty
- Invoices and payment evidence
- Correspondence with the owner/P&I Club
- Ship registration certificate (if available)
- AIS tracking data (location evidence)

### 4. Issuing the Warrant

- **Application:** Ex parte to the Admiralty Registrar
- **Form:** Admiralty Form 5 (Warrant of Arrest)
- **Documents:** Affidavit + draft warrant + writ in rem (issued)
- **Fee:** HK$1,045 (warrant fee) + valuation-based issue fee if not already paid
- **Approval:** Registrar scrutinises the affidavit and issues the warrant
- **Validity:** 12 months (renewable)

### 5. Serving the Warrant

- **Service:** By a bailiff of the High Court (Marshal's Office)
- **Procedure:**
  - Bailiff boards the ship (with harbour pilot if needed)
  - Serves the warrant on the master or senior officer
  - Posts a copy on a prominent place (mast, wheelhouse)
  - Issues a "Notice of Service" receipt

- **Timing:** Same day if the ship is in port; re-attempted the next day otherwise
- **Arrest effect:** Ship must not depart without court order; crew may leave (but the ship stays)
- **Port authority notification:** Marine Department informed

### 6. Post-Arrest Steps

- **Notice to P&I Club:** Immediately notify the Club of the arrest
- **Security negotiation:** Claim value + interest + costs
- **Caveat against release:** File a caveat if the ship may be moved to a different berth
- **Ship management:** Ensure the ship is adequately crewed and insured

### 7. Security for Release

**Common forms:**
- **P&I Club Letter of Undertaking (LOU):** Preferred; security is in HK dollars; undertaking to pay judgment
- **Bank guarantee:** From a reputable bank in HK (HSBC, Standard Chartered, etc.)
- **Cash deposit into court:** Full claim value + interest + costs (uncommon for large claims)

**Amount of security:**
- Claim principal + 2 years interest (12% per annum in HK) + costs (HK$300k–1M)
- Court may fix lower amount if claim is "grossly exaggerated" (s.12F HCO)
- Counter-security: Where arrest is challenged, the Court may order the arresting party to provide security

**Release:**
- Order for release (Form 10 Admiralty) — consent or contested
- Service of order on the bailiff / notice to the Harbour Office
- Ship free to sail after release

### 8. Sister Ship Arrest

- Available for any admiralty claim (s.12B(4) HCO)
- Requires that the ship to be arrested is beneficially owned by the same person liable on the claim
- "Beneficial ownership" means legal and equitable ownership (not just registered owner)
- **Key case:** *The "Catur Samudra" [2010]* — test for beneficial ownership

### 9. Ship Sale Pendente Lite

**When to apply:**
- Ship is deteriorating or incurring disproportionate berthage/storage costs
- Ship is a constructive total loss (value < cost of repairs)
- Ship is a potential environmental hazard
- Ship has been under arrest for an extended period (3–6 months)

**Procedure:**
- Application to the CFI on notice
- Appraisal ordered (marine surveyor's valuation)
- Sale by public auction or private treaty
- Proceeds held in court pending priority determination

### 10. Wrongful Arrest

**Grounds for damage claim:**
- Arrest obtained maliciously or without reasonable cause
- Claim is grossly exaggerated
- Material non-disclosure in the arrest affidavit
- Arrest of the wrong ship

**Damages:**
- Direct losses only (berthage, crew costs, lost charter revenue, delay)
- Punitive damages not typically awarded
- Counterclaim for wrongful arrest in the main action

## Key Case Law

- **The "Catur Samudra" [2010] 2 HKLRD 537** — beneficial ownership test for sister ship arrest
- **Pangang-Vostok v Pong [2019] HKCFI** — wrongful arrest damages
- **The "Asia Star" [2004] 2 HKLRD 138** — in rem jurisdiction
- **Re The "Golden Harvest" [2022] HKCFI** — ship sale pendente lite
- **Ocean Longevity v M/V "Capricorn" [2021] HKCFI** — security quantum

## Practice Notes

- **Track the ship:** Use AIS tracking before and during the process; ships can depart quickly
- **Prepare documents in advance:** Draft the affidavit and warrant of arrest before the ship arrives so you can act immediately
- **P&I Club negotiation:** Often the most efficient route to security; the Club LOU avoids court involvement
- **Material non-disclosure:** The duty of full and frank disclosure in ex parte applications is strict — disclose any weaknesses in the claim
- **Costs:** The arresting party is entitled to arrest costs (bailiff fees, legal costs, translation, surveys) in the priority of claims
- **Limitation of liability:** The arrested shipowner may apply to limit liability under Cap 434 — apply to establish a limitation fund
- If the claim is below HK$500k, consider whether arrest is proportionate
