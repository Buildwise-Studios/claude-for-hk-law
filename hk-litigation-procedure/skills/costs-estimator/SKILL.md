  Estimate litigation costs on a party-party or indemnity basis under the
  Rules of the High Court (Cap 4A, O.62) and Rules of the District Court
  (Cap 336H, O.62). Estimates costs for each phase of litigation
  (pleadings, discovery, trial, appeal) and compares likely recovery on
  party-party vs indemnity assessment. Includes HK costs-shifting analysis.

1. Load `CLAUDE.md` for the costs framework (RHC O.62 / RDC O.62).
2. Gather case context: court, case complexity, estimated hearing days, number of witnesses, discovery scope.
3. Estimate phase-by-phase costs.
4. Apply basis of assessment (party-party vs indemnity).
5. Produce a costs estimate with recovery analysis.

## Costs Framework

### Basis of Assessment (O.62)

| Basis | Test | Approximate recovery |
|---|---|---|
| **Party and party (standard)** | Costs "necessary and proper" for the attainment of justice — Interlocutory Chambers costs Taxing Master scale | ~60–70% of actual |
| **Indemnity basis** | All costs except those unreasonably incurred or of an unreasonable amount — more generous; all doubts resolved in favour of the receiving party | ~80–90% of actual |
| **Common fund** | Applies to legal aid; more generous | |

### Scale of Costs (O.62, Appendix — prescribed scales)

HK courts have prescribed scales for certain items (e.g., solicitor's fees for interlocutory applications, brief fees per day). The Taxing Master applies these scales unless the court orders otherwise.

- **Scale A:** Lower value claims, simpler work
- **Scale B:** Standard matters
- **Scale C:** Complex/higher value claims

Taxing Master's scale rates should be verified against current scales. Review with a practising HK costs specialist for a formal estimate.`
