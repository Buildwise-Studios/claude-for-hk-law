## Appeal Route Decision Tree

### Step 1: Identify the Originating Court or Tribunal

| Originating body | Appeal goes to |
|---|---|
| Master of the CFI | Judge in Chambers (CFI) |
| CFI Judge (final order) | Court of Appeal |
| CFI Judge (interlocutory) | Court of Appeal (leave usually required) |
| District Court Judge | Court of Appeal |
| Registrar of DC | Judge in Chambers (DC) |
| Labour Tribunal | CFI (point of law only — leave required) |
| Small Claims Tribunal | CFI (point of law or jurisdiction — leave required) |
| Lands Tribunal | CA (final order) / CFI (interlocutory) |
| Court of Appeal | Court of Final Appeal |

### Step 2: Determine Leave Requirements

| Route | Leave required? | Who grants leave? |
|---|---|---|
| Master → Judge (Chambers) | No (unless interlocutory matters under specific rules) | — |
| DC → CA (amount < HK$1M) | Yes | CA (single judge) |
| DC → CA (amount ≥ HK$1M) | Usually no, but CA may require | — |
| CFI → CA (final order) | No (as of right) | — |
| CFI → CA (interlocutory) | Yes | CA |
| Labour Tribunal → CFI | Yes | CFI (on point of law only) |
| Small Claims → CFI | Yes | CFI (on point of law/jurisdiction) |
| CA → CFA (value ≥ HK$1M) | No (appeal as of right) | — |
| CA → CFA (value < HK$1M) | Yes | CFA Appeal Committee |
| CA → CFA (criminal) | Yes | CFA Appeal Committee |

### Step 3: Calculate Time Limits

| Route | Time limit | From when |
|---|---|---|
| Master → Judge (Chambers) | 14 days | Date of order (unless otherwise directed) |
| DC → CA | 14–28 days | Date of judgment/order |
| CFI → CA | 28 days (final) / 14 days (interlocutory) | Date of order |
| Labour Tribunal → CFI | 7 days | Date of LT order |
| Small Claims → CFI | 7 days | Date of order |
| Lands Tribunal → CA | 28 days | Date of order |
| CA → CFA (Notice of Motion) | 28 days | Date of CA order/judgment |

### Step 4: Procedural Requirements

#### Appeal to Court of Appeal (RHC O.59)

| Step | Timing | Document |
|---|---|---|
| Notice of Appeal | Within time limit (above) | Form — must specify order, grounds, and relief |
| Respondent's Notice | 21 days after Notice of Appeal served | If respondent varies order |
| Skeleton argument (appellant) | 14 days before hearing | Concise, numbered, with authorities |
| Skeleton argument (respondent) | 7 days before hearing | |
| Appeal bundle | 7 days before hearing | Indexed, paginated |

#### Appeal to Court of Final Appeal (Cap 484A)

| Step | Timing | Document |
|---|---|---|
| Notice of Motion (leave) | 28 days of CA order | Form CFA 1 |
| Appeal Committee | Screened in chambers (3 judges) | Written submissions |
| Full hearing (if leave granted) | Set by the Registrar | Fresh notice of appeal required |

### Step 5: Special Considerations

#### Stays Pending Appeal

- **Automatic stay:** None — a party must apply for a stay of execution pending appeal.
- **Stay conditions:** Security for costs, payment into court, or undertakings.

#### Security for Costs on Appeal

- Appellant ordinarily resident outside HK: security for costs may be required.
- In CA, the respondent may apply for security (O.59, r.10).

#### Intervener

- The Secretary for Justice may intervene on constitutional questions (CFA Rules).
- Amicus curiae: CFA and CA may invite.
