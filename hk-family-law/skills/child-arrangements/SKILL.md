# Child Arrangements — Skill

## Purpose

Guide practitioners through the process of advising on, negotiating, and litigating child arrangements in Hong Kong, including custody, access, maintenance, relocation, and supervision under the Guardianship of Minors Ordinance (Cap 13), the Separation and Maintenance Orders Ordinance (Cap 16), and the Parent and Child Ordinance (Cap 429).

## Scope

- Welfare principle (paramountcy)
- Custody and access arrangements
- Joint vs sole custody
- Specific issue orders
- Relocation (leave to remove)
- Child maintenance
- Parental responsibility
- Hague Convention and child abduction
- Child representation and welfare reports

## Workflow

### 1. Welfare Principle (s.3 Cap 13)

The welfare of the child is the **paramount consideration**. The court considers:

- The child's physical, emotional, and educational needs
- The child's wishes and feelings (age and maturity dependent)
- The effect of change on the child
- The child's age, sex, background, and relevant characteristics
- Any harm the child has suffered or is at risk of suffering
- The capability of each parent to meet the child's needs
- The range of powers available to the court

### 2. Custody Arrangements

**Sole Custody**:
- One parent has day-to-day care and control
- Restricted to cases where the other parent is unfit or dangerous
- Becoming increasingly rare

**Joint Custody**:
- Both parents share major decision-making (education, medical, religion)
- One parent has primary care and control
- Preserved relationship with both parents
- Detailed access/contact schedule is essential

**Shared Care / 50:50**:
- Both parents have roughly equal time with the child
- Requires geographical proximity and workable logistics
- Increasingly encouraged in case law (especially for older children)

**Access / Contact**:
- Reasonable access: by agreement
- Defined access: specific days, times, holidays
- Supervised access: when there are safety concerns (supervised by Social Welfare or family members)
- Indirect access: phone, video calls, letters (international cases)

### 3. Specific Issue Orders

Court resolves a specific dispute on:
- **Education** — choice of school (local vs international, public vs private)
- **Medical treatment** — vaccinations, elective procedures, religious objections
- **Religion** — upbringing in a particular faith
- **Name change** — requires both parents' consent or court order
- **Passport** — applications requiring both parents' consent

### 4. Relocation (Leave to Remove)

**Internal relocation** (within HK):
- No court order needed — moving within HK is generally permitted
- Court may intervene if it significantly affects access

**International relocation**:
- Consent of the other parent or court order required (s.8, Cap 13)
- The child must not be removed from HK without consent or leave (Cap 512)

**Leading HK Principle — PD v LKW**:
- The welfare of the child is paramount
- The applicant must show a genuine and well-thought-out plan
- The court considers:
  - Motive of the relocating parent (genuine desire to relocate vs. frustrating contact)
  - Practicality of maintaining contact with the left-behind parent
  - The child's connection to both HK and the proposed destination
  - Impact on the child
  - Likelihood of improved quality of life
  - Financial implications for both parents

**Commonly imposed conditions**:
- Defined contact schedule (skype, regular visits, extended holidays)
- Return undertakings for specified periods
- Financial security for travel costs
- Reporting requirements

### 5. Child Maintenance

**Duty to Maintain**:
- Both parents have a duty to maintain their children (s.2, Cap 16; s.10, Cap 13)
- Duty applies to biological and adopted children
- For children aged 18+, only if in full-time education, training, or has a disability

**Child Maintenance Guidelines**:
| Number of Children | % of Net Income |
|-------------------|----------------|
| 1 | 20% |
| 2 | 30% |
| 3+ | 40% |

**Departures from Guidelines**:
- Shared care reduces the percentage
- High-income cases: court may use a ceiling approach or apply a reduced percentage
- Additional expenses: school fees, medical insurance, extracurricular activities
- Special needs: increased maintenance

**Duration**:
- Up to 18 (21 if in tertiary education)
- May extend beyond for children with disabilities

**Variation**:
- Change of circumstances (job loss, income change, child's needs change)
- Application to court with updated disclosure

### 6. Parental Responsibility (Cap 429)

- Both parents have parental responsibility regardless of marital status
- Mother always has parental responsibility
- Father has parental responsibility if married to the mother at birth or by subsequent agreement/order
- Unmarried father may acquire PR by agreement with the mother or court order

### 7. Welfare Reports and CAFCASS

- **Social Welfare Officer reports**: Family Caseworker from SWD investigates and reports to the court
- **Psychological reports**: appointed by the court in complex cases
- **Child's wishes**: court may appoint a Guardian ad Litem (for serious cases) or interview the child in chambers

### 8. Hague Convention (Cap 512)

- **Wrongful removal/retention**: Child taken from or retained outside HK in breach of custody rights
- **Prompt return**: Must be returned to country of habitual residence
- **Defences**: Consent, acquiescence, grave risk, mature child's objection (maturity and strength of objection considered), human rights
- **Central Authority in HK**: Director of Social Welfare
- **Non-Convention countries**: Use wardship jurisdiction (CFI)

### 9. Practice Notes

- **Hague Convention**: Mainland China is NOT a Convention state — different procedures apply
- **Child removal warning**: If abduction risk exists, apply for a prohibited steps order or tip-off to immigration (POL.26)
- **Parental alienation**: Increasingly recognised — expert evidence may be needed
- **Urgent applications**: Ex parte orders available for immediate protection or recovery

## Key Sections

| Section | Subject | Key Detail |
|---------|---------|------------|
| s.3 Cap 13 | Welfare principle | Child's welfare is paramount |
| s.10 Cap 13 | Custody and access | Court's jurisdiction |
| s.8 Cap 13 | Specific issue orders | Education, medical, religion, removal |
| s.10–12 Cap 16 | Child maintenance | Duty to maintain, variation |
| s.3–5 Cap 429 | Parental responsibility | Definition and attribution |
| s.3 Cap 512 | Hague Convention | Wrongful removal regime |

## Common Pitfalls

- **Relocation without consent**: Removing a child without consent is a criminal offence under Cap 512
- **Parental responsibility**: Unmarried fathers do NOT automatically have PR — must acquire it
- **Maintenance guidelines**: Apply as default, but the court has discretion in high-value or shared-care cases
- **Supervised access**: Must be clearly defined (who will supervise, where, for how long)
- **Welfare reports**: Can take 8–12 weeks — factor into case timeline
- **Immigration issues**: Removing a child to a non-Hague state may make recovery extremely difficult
